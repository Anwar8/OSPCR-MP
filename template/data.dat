Note that your data file MUST include ID as its first column, and the separation between the ID 
and the next data entry MUST be a single tab (tab, the button on your keyboad above CapsLock). 
This is done automatically if you prepare your data in excel and then copy it to the data.dat file.
The first line is always there to help you organize your data and will be ignored in the analysis. 
Your actual input arguments start from line 2 onwards. Now that you have read this message, you 
should be able to create your own data files depending on the input your tcl script requires.
